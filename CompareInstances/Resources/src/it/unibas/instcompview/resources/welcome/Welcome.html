            This application allows you to compare two instances choosing<br>
            between two different algorithms: Signature and Bruteforce.<br><br>
            You first have to load a Scenario.<br>
            You can load it by choosing its .properties file.<br><br>
            Once you have loaded it, you can double-click on it or press<br>
            the "Compare Instances" icon to run the algorithm.<br>
            It will display a new tab with all the information you need:<br>
            score of the applied algorithm, settings, tuple mappings and<br>
            value mappings.<br><br>
            To see what tuples have been left out,<br>
            because they couldn't be matched,explore the 2 databases.<br>
            By opening the tables, you will be able to see what tuples<br>
            have been excluded.<br><br>
